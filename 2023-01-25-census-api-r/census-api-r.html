<li>An API that gives access to data from many programs</li>

<li>American Community Survey: tables and microdata</li>
<li>Decennial Census</li>
<li>Population Estimates and Projections</li>
<li>And more</li>

<li>ACS tables, ACS microdata, Decennial tables, PEP tables, and ACS migration flow data</li>
<li>Wrappers are written so you don’t have to understand the API details</li>

1 The Annual Social and Economic Supplement or March CPS supplement is the primary source of detailed information on income and work experience in the United States. Numerous publications based on this survey are issued each year by the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Census. A public-use microdata file is available for private researchers, who also produce many academic and policy-related documents based on these&nbsp;data.&nbsp;The&nbsp;Annual Social and Economic Supplement is used to generate the annual Population Profile of the United States, reports on geographical mobility and educational attainment, and detailed analysis of money income and poverty status. The labor force and work experience data from this survey are used to profile the U.S. labor market and to make employment&nbsp;projections.&nbsp;To&nbsp;allow for the same type of in-depth analysis of&nbsp;hispanics, additional&nbsp;hispanic&nbsp;sample units are added to the basic CPS sample in March each year. Additional weighting is also performed so that estimates can be made for households and families, in addition to persons.

Monthly labor force data for the country are used by the &amp;lt;ahref="http://www.bls.gov"&amp;gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; to determine the distribution of funds under the Job Training Partnership Act. These data are collected through combined computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) and computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In addition to the labor force data, the CPS basic funding provides annual data on work experience, income, health insurance, and migration data from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC), and on school enrollment of the population from the October Supplement. Other supplements, some of which are sponsored by other agencies, are conducted biennially or intermittently.
