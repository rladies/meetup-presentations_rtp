# Data visualization in R with ggplot2

Materials for ggplot2 R-Ladies RTP meetup.

Sign up here: https://www.meetup.com/R-Ladies-RTP/events/258907954/

While the materials for the workshop are designed for being used at the in-person
workshop, all are welcomed to use and reuse them for learning and teaching.

The slides for the workshop can be found here: [TBD]

This workshop assumes no background in R but willingness to learn a scripting
language.

Focus of the workshop is data visualization in R with the ggplot2 package, and
not statistical data analysis.

All events are intended for women as leaders, mentors, members, and attendees. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly. Men are welcomed to attend *as guests* and must be accompanied by the R-Lady who invited them. This group was created so those who identify as women have a comfortable place to learn. If you would like to attend and feel excluded, please introduce yourself to an organizer.
