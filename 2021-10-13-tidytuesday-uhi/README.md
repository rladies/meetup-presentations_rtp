This will be the first part of a multipart TidyTuesday event where we will be looking at a local (!) urban heat mapping dataset brought to us by collaborators at the [Museum of Life and Science](https://www.lifeandscience.org/) and the [State Climate Office of NC](https://climate.ncsu.edu/). These data were collected using [PocketLab temperature sensors](https://www.thepocketlab.com/store/pocketlab-weather?hsLang=en) as folks walked around Durham and Raleigh this past summer (#walkingForScience). You can read hear more about this project in this WUNC feature [here](https://www.wunc.org/race-demographics/2021-08-11/urban-heat-mapping-project-durham-race-policies-climate-google).
